# Welcome to Jona Labs ⚛️

I created this as a showcase project to demonstrate my approaches to how I

- write and structure components and hooks
- organize files
- document functionality
- use GIT

in a modern multiplatform application. It is my main playground for both app-wide features, and smaller
self-contained functionality.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## How to run this
`NOTE:` Because of added native code Expo Go won't work. Please specify which platform you would like to launch. 
If you want to run android or iOS, you need to set up your development environment according 
to [this](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=ios&device=simulated&mode=development-build&buildEnv=local). 

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   yarn ios || yarn android || yarn web
   ```
