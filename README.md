# Welcome to Jona Labs ⚛️

I created this as a showcase project to demonstrate my approaches to how I

- write and structure components and hooks
- organize files
- document functionality
- use GIT

in a modern multiplatform application. It is my main playground for both app-wide features, and smaller
self-contained functionality.

`DISCLAIMER:` No AI was used to create code, unless explicitly mentioned otherwise!

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## How to run this
`NOTE:` Because of added native code Expo Go won't work. Please specify which platform you would like to launch.

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   yarn ios || yarn android || yarn web
   ```
